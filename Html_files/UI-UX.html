            <h1>What is UI Design?</h1>
            <p> To define “UI” Design, it stands for User Interface Design. It is a process where design teams create the <br> aesthetics of digital products like applications, official websites, icons, or landing pages that meet the company's requirements and ensure <br> that the products are intuitive, easy to use, and visually appealing.
                <br><br>
                In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, <br> UI designers strive to make their digital creations simple to use and intuitive. <br> To produce a seamless and pleasurable user experience, they take into account things like button placement, <br> navigation menus, colour schemes, typography, and general design components</p>

                <p  class="specific">Ever wondered what "UX" design actually means?  In any case, it refers to "User Experience Design." It all boils down to how users <br> interact with and view digital items, including websites, applications, and any other digital interface on their devices. <br>
                   Using a social media app and trying to add a story to your profile but being unable to locate the sharing option might be uncomfortable. But it feels amazing when adding the story is simple and easy, isn't it?<br><br>
                    
                   This is where a UX designer steps in to ensure the application or website is slick and simple to use & operate. <br> An app's user experience and interface readability have a significant impact. On the other hand, an interface that is poorly designed <br> might be confusing and make you feel lost. <br><br>
                    
                   UX's core objective is ensuring that utilizing an app or website is simple. Making progress should feel effortless, <br> not like you're battling with technology. All of this depends on the carefully <br> selected user interface components that UI designers use.</p>
