        <h1 class="title-chapter1">Difference Between Scripting , Programming & Markup Languages</h1>
        <div class="text-container-chapter1">
            <h1>Scripting Language</h1>
            <p>A script is basically a programming language in which compilation steps are not mandatory to run the
                program. Script languages are like subdomains of programming that are used to provide guidance to other
                programs or we can use them to control other programs, so it also contains instructions. this technique
                is never standalone because it is used to connect a programming language to another which is an
                important step. The scripting process does not need a specific compiling process but it requires to be
                interpreted (Scanning the script by line number instead of compiling). This technique is used to combine
                existing components where scripts are running inside another program or creating dependencies. Low
                maintenance scripting languages are PHP, JavaScript, and VBScript, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-container-chapter1">
            <h1>Programming Language</h1>
            <p>Programming languages are compiler-based languages are developed from scratch and that run independently
                as compared to scripting languages. In programming, a set of instructions or code tells an operation to
                be performed. In programming, a logical structure and generic statements are provided, and a definite
                set of input instructions will perform output. These given instructions are always written in a
                human-readable language and here the compiler comes into the picture where these languages are converted
                to binary format or also known as machine language (language to be understood by the computers). These
                concepts are completely different from the scripting language as explained before.
                <br><br>
                Examples of Programming languages include C, C++, C#, Java, etc. These languages support modern hardware
                and compilation techniques.
                Other Languages like Python sit in both programming and scripting types because many coders use this
                language without a compilation step, but the central part of implementing the python must require a
                compilation, and only after that it can be run in the bytecode.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-container-chapter1">
            <h1>Markup Language</h1>
            <p>Markup languages are also languages, but we can't say that markup languages contain programming
                fundamentals, because these languages are not to be executed or used to perform such actions, moreover,
                these markups can be used in the data structure, data identifying, or presenting data in required cases.
                <br><br>
                Examples of markup languages are HTML (Hyper-text Markup Language), XHTML (same with HTML but with some
                differences), XML (for data structuring), etc. Markup languages are completely different from
                programming languages and scripting languages, and these markups do not contain any systematic logic or
                algorithm.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-container-chapter1">
            <h1>Note :</h1>
            <p>All the scripting languages are subdomains of programming languages but all the programming languages are
                not scripting languages. C++ can never be said to be a scripting language because it contains logical
                techniques, so it's just a programming language but we can say JavaScript programming or scripting
                languages because it contains both. Scripting languages usually show slow behavior than programming
                languages because compiled programs are converted into machine language first.</p>

                HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.</p>
            <p>HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</p>

                <p>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <span></span>
                <p>Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <span></span>
                <p>Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="explain-container">
            <p>The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.
               HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
                <br><br>
                All HTML pages have a ments, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="element-parts-container">
            <h3>The three main parts of an element are: </h3>
            <div>
                <span></span>
                <p><b> Opening tag : </b> used to state where an element starts to take effect . The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets . For example , use the start tag &quot; &lt; p &gt; &quot; to create a paragraph. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span></span>
                <p><b> Content : </b> this is the output that other users see. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span></span>
                <p><b> Closing tag : </b> the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example, &quot; &lt; p &gt; &quot; to end a paragraph. </p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="explanation-element-parts-container">
            <p>The combination of these three parts will create an HTML element:</p>
            <pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
            <p>Another critical part of an HTML element is its attribute, which has two sections – a name and attribute value. The name identifies the additional information that a user wants to add, while the attribute value gives further specifications. </p>
            <p>For example, a style element adding the color purple and the font-family verdana will look like this:</p>
            <pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p style=<span class="blue">"color:purple;font-family:verdana"</span> </span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
            <p>Another attribute, the HTML class, is most important for development and programming. The class attribute adds style information that can work on different elements with the same class value. </p>
            <p>For example, we will use the same style for a heading  &nbsp;&lt; h1 &gt;&nbsp; and a paragraph &nbsp;&lt; p &gt;&nbsp; The style includes background color, text color, border, margin, and padding, under the class .important. To achieve the same style between &nbsp;&lt; h1 &gt;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&lt; p &gt;&nbsp; , add &nbsp; <span class="blue"> class = " important " </span> after each start tag: </p>


            <div class="class-explanation">
                &lt; html &gt;<br>
                &lt; head &gt;<br>
                &lt; style &gt;<br>
                .important {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; background-color: blue;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; color: white;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; border: 2px solid black;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; margin: 2px;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; padding: 2px;<br>
                } <br>
                &lt; / style &gt;<br>
                &lt; / head &gt;<br>
                &lt; body &gt;<br>
                <br>
                &lt; h1 &nbsp; <span class="blue"> class="important" </span> &gt; This is a heading  &lt; / h1  &gt;<br>
                &lt; p &nbsp; <span class="blue"> class="important" </span> &gt;   This is a paragraph.  &lt; / p &gt;<br>
                <br>
                &lt; / body &gt;<br>
                &lt; / html &gt;
            </div>

            <p>Most elements have an opening and a closing tag, but some elements do not need closing tags to work, such as empty elements. These elements do not use an end tag because they do not have content:</p>
            <pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span><span>&lt;</span>img src= <span class="blue"> "/" </span>alt= <span class="blue">"Image"</span></span>&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>This image tag has two attributes – an <span>&nbsp; src &nbsp;</span> attribute, the image path, and an <span>&nbsp; alt &nbsp;</span> attribute, the descriptive text. However, it does not have content nor an end tag. </p>
            <p>Lastly, every HTML document must start with a <span>&nbsp; &lt; !DOCTYPE &gt;&nbsp; </span> declaration to inform the web browser about the document type. With HTML5, the doctype HTML public declaration will be:</p>
            <pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt; !DOCTYPE &gt;</code></pre>

        <h1 class="title">How Are HTML, CSS, and Javascript <br> Related</h1>
        <div class="chapter6-content">
            <p>HTML is used to add text elements and create the structure of content. However, it is not enough to build a professional and fully responsive website. So, HTML needs the help of <a href=""> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </a> and <a href=""> JavaScript</a> to create the vast majority of website content. </p>
            <p>CSS is responsible for stylings such as background, colors, layouts, spacing, and animations. On the other hand, JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as sliders, pop-ups, and photo galleries. These three languages are the fundamentals of front-end development.</p>
